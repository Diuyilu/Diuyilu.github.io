title: "The extension of space-time with rebooted cognition -- discriminating the underlying logic of meta-universe and meta-realm"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-04-15
excerpt: 'By creating an integrated content production platform that integrates intelligent content creation, intelligent content processing, intelligent content operation, intelligent content recommendation, and intelligent content review, an intelligent omnimedia multimodal communication system has gradually taken shape. Computing allows media technology to further extend, and the extension of media allows us to better understand ourselves and perceive the world. Thinking about the future of the meta-universe at the intersection of aggregated technology, artificial intelligence, synthetic media, and social governance can lead to a better understanding of the role and responsibility of the physical world for the digital world.'
