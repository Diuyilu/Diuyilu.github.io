collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-02-11-paper-1
excerpt: 'This article proposes a studio design based on virtual reality technology, which can solve the problem of difficult film and television production in low-cost studios. The solution is divided into four steps: building a virtual environment; recording and live broadcasting of real-person appearances; binding facial movements of virtual characters; and recording and live broadcasting of virtual anchor appearances. The design proposed in this article can complete the functions of the studio through computers, mobile phones and camera equipment, control the facial movements of virtual characters in real time, reduce the difficulty of producing recorded and live videos, and further promote the application of virtual reality technology.'
