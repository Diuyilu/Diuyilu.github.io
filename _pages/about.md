I'm a a first-year PhD student from [MCC](https://mcc.cuc.edu.cn/), [Communication University Of China](https://www.cuc.edu.cn/). My research directions are public opinion analysis, open source intelligence analysis, and large models

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shen Hao](https://xinwenxueyuan.cuc.edu.cn/2021/0608/c7648a182645/page.htm) of State Key Laboratory of Media Convergence and Communication from [School of Journalism](https://xinwenxueyuan.cuc.edu.cn/main.htm), Communication University Of China.
